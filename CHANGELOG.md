## [0.8.5] - 2022-12-09

### Fixed
- use event ID of currently up/downloading event, not whole event object when checking missing events

## [0.8.4] - 2022-12-09
### Added
- Logging of remaining upload queue size

### Fixed
- Uploading files were not accounted for when checking for missing events
- Buffer size parameter is logged in human-readable format 

## [0.8.3] - 2022-12-08
### Added
- Now logs time zone settings for both the host and NVR
- Color logging is now optional and defaults to disabled (to match previous behavior before v0.8.0)
- Ability to configure download buffer size (bumped default up to 512MiB)
- Event IDs to upload/download logging

### Fixed
- Log spam when lots of events are missing, this will now only occur if the logging level is set to `EXTRA_DEBUG` (-vv)
- corrected logging not showing smart detection types
- The application no longer stalls when a video is downloaded larger than the available buffer size
- Ability to set the least verbose logging for the docker container

## [0.8.2] - 2022-12-05
### Fixed
- Fixed issue where command output was being returned with added indentation intended for logging only
- Fixed issue where some command logging was not indented
- Fixed issue where the tool could crash when run in a container if /config/database didn't exist

## [0.8.1] - 2022-12-04
version 0.8.0 was used by accident previously and PyPI would not accept it so bumping by one patch version

## [0.8.0] - 2022-12-03
Major internal refactoring. Each task is now its own class and asyncio task.

### Added
- A database of backed up events and where they are stored
- A periodic check for missed events
  - This will also ensure past events before the tool was used are backed up, up until the retention period

### Fixed
- Pruning is no longer done based on file timestamps, the database is used instead. The tool will no longer delete files it didn't create.
- Pruning now runs much more frequently (every minute) so retention periods of less than a day are now possible.
