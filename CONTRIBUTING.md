## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `unifi-protect-backup` for local development.

1. Fork the `unifi-protect-backup` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/unifi-protect-backup.git
    ```

3. Ensure [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is installed.
4. Create virtual environment and install dependencies:

    ```
    $ uv install --dev
    ```

5. Create a branch for local development:

    ```
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

6. To run `unifi-protect-backup` while developing you will need to either
   be inside the `poetry shell` virtualenv or run it via poetry:

   ```
   $ uv run unifi-protect-backup {args}
   ```

7. Install pre-commit git hooks to ensure all code commit to the repository
   is formatted correctly and meets coding standards:

   ```
   $ uv run pre-commit install
   ```

8. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the
   tests:

    ```
    $ uv run pytest
    ```

8. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

    ```
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

9. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring. If adding a CLI
   option, you should update the "usage" in README.md.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.10. Check
   https://github.com/ep1cman/unifi-protect-backup/actions
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

## Tips

```
$ uv run pytest tests/test_unifi_protect_backup.py
```

To run a subset of tests.


## Deploying

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in CHANGELOG.md).
Then run:

```
$ uv run bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags
```

GitHub Actions will then deploy to PyPI, produce a GitHub release, and a container
build if tests pass.
